# A (test) Version of a PostFix Calculator

## (test) Idea

>**Mission**: reading a String and interpreting it as a Post Fix Calculation and then solving it and
>returning the solution (as a String or a Integer or Double, doesn't matter for now)
>  

>**Idea**: using char arrays with a loop and checking if the char is a operator like: (+,-,*,/) and then with the operator calculating the last two digits.
>  

> **Practice**: Used different types of arrays, but not character arrays. Also made use of a `count` variable and several attributes. The program works to some extent, but not entirely ‚Äî for example, a calculation with three numbers followed by an operator does not work correctly.

## Actual Implementation

### Node Class (String)

> The ``Node.java`` Class serves as one element in the linked list's, it has a data Attribute, which is the Data Element, and a next attribute, which is a reference to the next Element and also a previous attribute, which point to the previous Element.

### MySingleLinkedList Class (T)

> Using the Node Object as a Element, the Object can be used as a Single Linked List. It comes with Methods such as ``addFirst``/ ``addLast()`` , ``first()``/``last()`` returning the first or last Element of the List, a ``size()`` method, returning the size of the list in a integer form, a ``isEmpty()`` Method, returning a true boolean if the List is empty and a ``printList()`` method, printing the Elements of the list and the pointer  
> *Example: 10 -> 20 -> null*

### MyLinkedList Class (T)

> Using the Node Object as a Element, the Object can be usede as a (Double) Linked List. It comes with Methods like ``size()``, returning the amount of Elements in the List as a Integer, ``isEmpty()``, returning a boolean value depending on if the list is empty or not, a ``first()`` method, returning the first element of the list and ``addFirst()``, adding an Element to the first position (head) of the List as well as ``removeFirst()``, removing the first Element of a list. It also has methods for the last position of the list (tail), such as ``last()``, returning the last element and ``addLast()``, adding a Element to the end of an list as well as a ``removeLast()`` removing the last Element of the list. For Test purposes it also comes with a ``printList()`` Method printing the list elements and their refrences:  
> *Example: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> null*

### PostFixCalculator Class

A Java class to calculate and convert Postfix and Infix mathematical expressions.

This class supports the evaluation of **Postfix (Reverse Polish Notation)** expressions and includes utility methods for converting between Postfix and Infix notation.  
It uses a **Singly Linked List** as the internal data structure for stack-like behavior.

---

#### ‚úÖ isOperator(String token)

Checks whether a given token is a valid arithmetic operator.  
Supported operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

- **Returns:** `true` if the token is an operator, otherwise `false`.

---

#### ‚úÖ isOperatorExtended(String token)

Checks whether a given token is a valid operator or parenthesis.  
Supported tokens: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(`, `)`

- **Returns:** `true` if the token is an operator or parenthesis, otherwise `false`.

---

#### üßÆ calculatePostFix(String expression)

Evaluates the result of a **Postfix expression**.  
The input string must be space-separated (e.g., `"3 4 + 5 *"`).  
Internally uses a singly linked list as a stack.

- **Input:** `"3 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 +"`
- **Output:** `"25"`

- **Throws:** `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid operators or values.

---

#### üîÅ convertPostfixToInfix(String expression)

Converts a **Postfix expression** into an **Infix expression** with proper parentheses.  
Useful for understanding the expression in a more familiar format.

- **Input:** `"3 4 + 2 *"`
- **Output:** `"((3 + 4) * 2)"`

- **Throws:** `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid tokens.

---

#### üîÑ convertInfixToPostfix(String expression)

Converts an **Infix expression** into **Postfix (RPN)** notation using operator precedence and parentheses.  
Uses the Shunting Yard Algorithm.

- **Input:** `"( 3 + 4 ) * 2"`
- **Output:** `"3 4 + 2 *"`

- **Note:** Input must be space-separated (e.g., `"3 + 4"` NOT `"3+4"`)

- **Throws:** `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid tokens.

---

#### üß† precedence(String operator)

Returns the **precedence level** of the provided operator, used in expression conversion.

| Operator | Precedence |
|----------|------------|
| `+`, `-` | 1          |
| `*`, `/` | 2          |
| `(`, `)` | 3          |

- **Throws:** `IllegalArgumentException` for unknown operators.

---

#### ‚öñÔ∏è hasLowerPrecedence(String op1, String op2)

Compares two operators to determine if the first one (`op1`) has **lower or equal precedence** than the second (`op2`).  
Used to decide whether to pop from the operator stack during infix-to-postfix conversion.

- **Returns:** `true` if `op1` has lower or equal precedence, or is the same as `op2`.

---

#### üìå Example Usage

```java
PostFixCalculator calc = new PostFixCalculator();
String result = calc.calculatePostFix("3 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 +"); // ‚Üí "25"
String infix = calc.convertPostfixToInfix("3 4 + 2 *"); // ‚Üí "((3 + 4) * 2)"
String postfix = calc.convertInfixToPostfix("( 3 + 4 ) * 2"); // ‚Üí "3 4 + 2 *"
