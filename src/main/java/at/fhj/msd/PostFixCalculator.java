     *
     *
     * * Converts an infix expression (mathematical notation) into postfix
     * notation (Reverse Polish Notation).
     * <p>
     * This method uses a stack-based algorithm to convert an infix expression
     * into postfix form. The algorithm handles parentheses and operator
     * precedence, ensuring that the operators are placed in the correct order
     * according to the mathematical rules of precedence.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The algorithm works as follows:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the token is a number, it is added directly to the operand
     * list.</li>
     * <li>If the token is an operator, it is pushed onto the stack, but only
     * after removing any operators from the stack with higher or equal
     * precedence.</li>
     * <li>If the token is a closing parenthesis (')'), operators are popped
     * from the stack into the operand list until an opening parenthesis ('(')
     * is encountered, which is discarded.</li>
     * <li>At the end of the expression, any remaining operators in the stack
     * are moved to the operand list.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * The resulting postfix expression is returned as a string, where operands
     * and operators are separated by spaces.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>Important:</strong> When providing the infix expression as input,
     * ensure that there is a space between each element (operator, operand, or
     * parenthesis). For example, the expression "( 3 + 4 )" must be provided
     * with spaces between the numbers, operators, and parentheses.</p>
     *
     * @param expression the infix expression to be converted, with operators
     * and operands separated by spaces
     * @return the equivalent postfix expression
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if an element in the expression is
     * neither an operator nor a number
